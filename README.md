# Intel-OneAPI
The Class Monitoring System using AI and ML technology is designed to monitor real-time student behaviour in the classroom. It provides teachers and school administrators with valuable insights into student engagement, attendance, and behaviour. This system is particularly useful in identifying students who may be struggling or disengaged in class. In this project we used Intel's ONEAPI library OneDnn to increase the accuracy of the project.

## **FEATURES:**
The system can track a variety of data points including student attendance, behaviour, engagement and can detect if a student is sleeping, eating or using a mobile device in class. The system uses cameras and other sensors to monitor student behaviour and engagement during class, providing real-time feedback to the teacher. The system can also use facial recognition technology to track student attendance and ensure that all students are present in the classroom. In this project we have included real time behaviour of a student in the classroom which can detect if a student is using mobile phone, using laptop, talking with someone, drinking or sleeping in the classroom.

## **BUILT WITH:**
- First we implemented the libraries
- Understood about the data
- Tested different Models and find the best model out of it
- Trained the model using Intel OneAPI Dnn
- Saved the model

## **BENEFITS:**
The Class Monitoring System using AI and ML technology can provide numerous benefits for schools, educators and students. Here are a few specific benefits:

- **Improved Student Engagement:** The system can help identify students who may be struggling or disengaged in class. This enables teachers to provide targeted support to these students and help them become more engaged in their learning.

- **Personalised Learning:** The system can analyze student performance data to provide personalized recommendations for improvement. This can help students learn at their own pace and in a way that works best for them.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** The system can provide teachers with real-time feedback on student performance, allowing them to adjust their teaching methods and strategies on the fly.

- **Improved Student Outcomes:** By identifying areas where students are struggling and providing personalized recommendations for improvement, the system can help improve student outcomes and overall academic performance.

- **Enhanced Teacher Effectiveness:** The system can help teachers identify effective teaching practices and instructional strategies, which can help them become more effective educators.

## **INSPIRATION:**
The inspiration for building this project came from the desire to improve the learning experience for students and enhance the effectiveness of teachers in the classroom. With the advent of AI and ML technology, it has become possible to monitor student behavior and engagement in real-time, providing teachers with valuable insights and enabling them to adjust their teaching methods and strategies on the fly.
The project was motivated by the need to identify students who may be struggling or disengaged in class and provide targeted support to help them succeed. The system provides personalized recommendations for improvement and helps teachers identify effective teaching practices and instructional strategies. By automating certain tasks such as tracking attendance and behavior, the system also frees up teachers' time to focus on other aspects of their job.
This system can help improve student outcomes and enhance teacher effectiveness by providing personalized recommendations for improvement and identifying effective teaching practices. It is an essential tool for any school looking to improve student engagement, academic performance, and overall success.
The goal of this project is to help improve student outcomes and enhance teacher effectiveness, ultimately leading to a better learning experience for all students. The inspiration for building this project came from the belief that technology can be a powerful tool for improving education and that AI and ML can play a vital role in this process.

## **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:**
- **Expansion of dataset:** The system's accuracy and effectiveness can be improved by adding more data to the existing dataset. This could involve collecting additional information on student behavior and engagement in the classroom.

- **Increased accuracy:** The system can be fine-tuned to improve its accuracy, using advanced ML algorithms and techniques to identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent with the current system.

- **Additional parameters:** The system can be expanded to include more parameters that affect student behavior and engagement in the classroom, such as classroom temperature, noise level, and lighting.

- **Integration with other systems:** The system can be integrated with other technologies, such as learning management systems or assessment tools, to provide a more comprehensive view of student performance and engagement.

- **Implementation in other contexts:** The system can be adapted for use in other contexts beyond the classroom, such as in examinations or in corporate training programs.

- **Improvement in real-time feedback:** The system can be improved to provide real-time feedback to students, allowing them to track their own progress and identify areas where they need to improve.

## **OUTPUT:**


## **DISCLAIMER:**
In this project as a sample we have used a single model where the primary focus is on a single student and the student's laptop camera. Furthermore, this can be implemented on a large scale where a single camera can be fixed to take video of the entire class and generate reports individually.
